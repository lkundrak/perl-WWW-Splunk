    WWW::Splunk - Client library for Splunk log search engine

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Splunk;

      my $splunk = new WWW::Splunk ({
              host    => $host,
              port    => $port,
              login   => $login,
              password => $password,
              unsafe_ssl => 1,
              verbose => 0,
      });

      my $sid = $splunk->start_search ('selinux avc');
      $splunk->poll_search ($sid);
      until ($splunk->results_read ($sid)) {
        print scalar $splunk->search_results ($sid);
      }
      print " results found\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains utility functions for Splunk API, implementing
    version 4.1 API, verified to work with 4.2, 4.3 and 5.0.3 versions.

  start_search (string) [(since)] [(until)]
    Initiate a search, return a SID (Search ID) string.

  rt_search (string) (callback) [(since)] [(until)]
    Initiate a real-time search, calling a callback for each line matched.

    Finishes only if connection terminates (potentially never), returning
    number of results consumed.

  search_done (sid)
    Return true if the search is finished.

  poll_search (sid)
    Wait for a search to finish.

  search_results (sid)
    Return an array of the matched events. If called multiple times, it only
    returns events which were added from the time of the last call. Oh, and
    you can't run multiple search concurrently with single WWW::Splunk
    instance. Otherwise, WWW::Splunk is perfectly thread-safe.

  results_read (sid)
    Return true if search is finished and all there are no more results to
    read (everything was fetched with search_results).
